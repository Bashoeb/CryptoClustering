# Module 19 - CryptoClustering**

**Overview**

In this assignment, we will be working with cryptocurrency data to perform clustering using the K-means algorithm. The goal is to identify the best value for k (number of clusters) using both the original scaled data and PCA-transformed data, and then compare the results.

**Requriements**

Python v3.10.9
Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: A library for numerical operations and array manipulation.
Hvplot.pandas: A library for interactive plotting and visualization.
Scikit-learn: A library for machine learning and data preprocessing, including K-means clustering and PCA.
Resources

The crypto_market_data dataset is required for this assignment. It is saved in the resources folder of the GitHub repository associated with this project. This dataset contains the necessary cryptocurrency market data for clustering analysis.

**Note**: Please ensure that you have the required dataset in the specified location to successfully run the code and perform the clustering analysis.
